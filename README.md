# Cookbook Recipe
 
 This is a group project where a user can add or delete recipes, add or delete desserts, see the recipe of the week (recipe having most reviews), and dessert of the week.
 
 User must login in order to add or delete recipes but a user can still see all the food recipes without needing to login.
 
 A logged in user can add reviews and ratings to each recipe.
